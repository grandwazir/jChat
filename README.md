jChat - Simple chat prefix and suffixes
====================================

## Description

jChat is a simple and flexible plugin for the Minecraft wrapper [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) designed to allow adding prefixes and suffixes to players names. Currently it is only compatible with the inbuilt permissions in Bukkit. 

## Features

- Lightweight: only manages prefixes and suffixes.
- Modifies join, death and quit messages to reflect player's display names.
- Player list (tab) now reflects player's display names.
- Fast: Formats a players' name permanently on login and when a player changes worlds.
- Good citizen: Does not interfere with other chat plugins.
- Simple: Very easy to configure, simply assign the permission nodes to players.

## Installation

### Ensure you are using the latest recommended build.

Before installing, you need to make sure you are running at least the latest [recommended build](http://repo.bukkit.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=releases&g=org.bukkit&a=craftbukkit&v=RELEASE) for Bukkit. Support is only given for problems when using a recommended build. This does not mean that the plugin will not work on other versions of Bukkit, the likelihood is it will, but it is not supported.

### Getting jChat

The best way to install jChat is to use the [symbolic link](http://repository.james.richardson.name/symbolic/jChat.jar) to the latest version. This link always points to the latest version of jChat, so is safe to use in scripts or update plugins. Additionally you can to use the [RSS feed](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/jChat/files.rss) provided by BukkitDev as this also includes a version changelog.
    
Alternatively [older versions](http://repository.james.richardson.name/releases/name/richardson/james/bukkit/jchat/) are available as well, however they are not supported. If you are forced to use an older version for whatever reason, please let me know why by [opening a issue](https://github.com/grandwazir/jChat/issues/new) on GitHub.
