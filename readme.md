# jChat

jChat is a simple and flexible plugin designed to allow adding prefixes and suffixes to players names. Currently it is only compatible with the inbuilt permissions in Bukkit. 

## Features:

- Lightweight: only manages prefixes and suffixes
- Fast: Formats a players' name permanently on login instead of on every chat message.
- Simple: Very easy to configure, simply assign the permission nodes to players.

## Requirements

- Bukkit #1000 or higher
