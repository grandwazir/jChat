jChat - Simple chat prefix and suffixes
====================================

## Description

jChat is a simple and flexible plugin for the Minecraft wrapper [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) designed to allow adding prefixes and suffixes to players names. Currently it is only compatible with the inbuilt permissions in Bukkit. 

Further [instructions](https://github.com/grandwazir/jChat/wiki/instructions) and documentation is available on wiki. 

## Features

- Lightweight: only manages prefixes and suffixes.
- Modifies join, death and quit messages to reflect player's display names.
- Player list (tab) now reflects player's display names.
- Fast: Formats a players' name permanently on login and when a player changes worlds.
- Good citizen: Does not interfere with other chat plugins.
- Simple: Very easy to configure, simply assign the permission nodes to players.
